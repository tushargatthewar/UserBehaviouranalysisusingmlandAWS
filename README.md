## Introduction

The User Behavior Analysis System is designed to analyze log trails to gain insights into user behavior. By leveraging machine learning models, the system can predict user actions, segment users, and provide valuable business insights. The API is built using Flask and can be easily integrated into existing company systems.

## Features

- **Log Trail Analysis**: Analyze user log trails to understand behavior patterns.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Use scikit-learn models to predict user actions and segment users.
- **Seamless Integration**: Developed as an API for easy integration into existing systems.
- **Data Storage**: Utilizes MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deployable on AWS for scalability and reliability.
- **Google Analytics Integration**: Integrates with Google Analytics for enhanced data analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Cloud Services**: AWS
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, Numpy

## System Architecture

The system architecture consists of several components:

1. **Data Collection**: Collects log trails and user data from various sources including Google Analytics.
2. **Data Storage**: Stores the collected data in MongoDB.
3. **Data Processing**: Processes the data using Pandas and Numpy for feature extraction and transformation.
4. **Machine Learning**: Applies machine learning models using scikit-learn to analyze and predict user behavior.
5. **API**: Provides endpoints for integration using Flask.
6. **Deployment**: Deployed on AWS for scalability and reliability.
